To get started with K'8s, first simple example is to create a Pod. Pods are smallest units of software which can be created and deployed on containers.

To use the K'8s platform intially without installing K'8s we will use Katacoda platform.

Utility of K'8s is kubectl.

To write any files in Kubernetes it is callled as manifest file and always manifest file should end with xxx.yaml


Note: These pods are executed on the https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/kubernetes-sandbox/9781492062820/

mypod.yaml
---------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod

spec:
    containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
       
 --------------------------------
       
To run this pod
 $ kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
       
To check whether pod is running
 $ kubectl get pods

To delete any pod created 
$ kubectl delete pod pod_name

To check more information about the pod
$ kubectl describe pod pod_name

To check on which node pod is created
$ kubectl get -o wide

To delete a Pod
$ kubectl delete pod pod_name

NAMESPACE
--------------------------------

To create a namespace
$ kubectl create ns namespace

To see how many namespaces present in kubernetes
$ kubectl get ns  or kubectl get namespaces

To create a pod with ns
$ kubectl apply -f pod_name -n namespace
 eg: kubectl apply -f mypod -n sharan

To check the namespace
$ kubectl get ns

To check the pod with spacific namespace
$ kubectl get pods -n namespace

To delete the pod with specific namespace
$ kubectl delete pod -n namespace
