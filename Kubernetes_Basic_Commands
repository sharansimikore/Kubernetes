To get started with K'8s, first simple example is to create a Pod. Pods are smallest units of software which can be created and deployed on containers.

To use the K'8s platform intially without installing K'8s we will use Katacoda platform.

Componet/utility of K'8s is kubectl.

To write any files in Kubernetes it ia callled as manifest file and always manifest file should end with xxx.yaml

mypod.yaml
---------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod

spec:
    containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
       
 --------------------------------
       
To run this pod
 $ kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
       
To check whether pod is running
 $ kubectl get pods

To delete any pod created 
$ kubectl delete pod pod_name
