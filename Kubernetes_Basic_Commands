To get started with K'8s, first simple example is to create a Pod. Pods are smallest units of software which can be created and deployed on containers.

To use the K'8s platform intially without installing K'8s we will use Katacoda platform.

Utility of K'8s is kubectl.

To write any files in Kubernetes it is callled as manifest file and always manifest file should end with xxx.yaml


Note: These pods are executed on the https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/kubernetes-sandbox/9781492062820/

mypod.yaml
---------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod

spec:
    containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
       
 --------------------------------
       
To run this pod
 $ kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
       
To check whether pod is running
 $ kubectl get pods

To delete any pod created 
$ kubectl delete pod pod_name
