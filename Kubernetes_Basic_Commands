To get started with K'8s, first simple example is to create a Pod. Pods are smallest units of software which can be created and deployed on containers.

To use the K'8s platform intially without installing K'8s we will use Katacoda platform.

Componet of K'8s is kubectl.

mypod.yaml
---------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod

spec:
    containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
       
 --------------------------------
       
       To run this pod
       $ kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
       
       To check whether pod is running
       $ kubectl get pods
