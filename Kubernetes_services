In Kuberenetes pods can be created by they not exposed by default, to get expose we need to use a concept called Services.

To expose all the created pods to outside world, services are used

Types of services
----------------------------
1. ClusterIP    -  This is default service in Kubernetes. ClusterIP service will expose the pod within the k8's cluster
2. NodePort     -  This service will expose the pod to outside world --port forwarding
3. LoadBalancer -  This service can be used with the cloud providers only, this can be used to expose to the outside world.
4. Headless

manifest file or yaml file
-----------------------------------------
Declarative type : yaml file 
Imperative type  : commands to execute

-------------------------------------------------------------
Note that Service selector key value [app: sharan in service.yaml file] and pod label key value [app: sharan in deployment.yaml file] is same.
so endpoint gets an IP address so it means service is being exposed to outside worls

kubectl get pods --show-labes
----------------------------------------------------

To get all the services
$ kubectl get services/ svc

To check more infor about service
$ kubectl describe svs svc_name
