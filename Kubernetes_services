In Kuberenetes pods can be created by they not exposed by default, to get expose we need to use a concept called Services.

To expose all the created pods to outside world, services are used

Types of services
----------------------------
1. ClusterIP    -  If I want to expose the pod internally within the cluster
2. NodePort     -  If I want to expose the pod to outside world --port forwarding
3. LoadBalancer -  This service can be used with the cloud providers only, this can be used to expose to the outside world.
4. Headless


Whenever kind of type Deployment it is like a object Deployment

Wheneber kind of type Pod it is like a object Pod

If you create a pod for the deployment.yaml, even after deleting the pod another pod gets created as replicas is used 

To check hopw many replicas:
$ kubectl get replicaset

To scalet or increase pods:
$ kubectl scale deploy/deployment deployment_name --replicas=5   [deployment name is in the deployment.yaml file]
   eg: kubectl scale deploy nginx-deployment --replicas=5
   
To scalet down the pods:
$ kubectl scale deploy nginx-deployment --replicas=1
