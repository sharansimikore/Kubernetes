Whenever kind of type Deployment it is like a object Deployment

Wheneber kind of type Pod it is like a object Pod

If you create a pod for the deployment.yaml, even after deleting the pod another pod gets created as replicas is used 

To check hopw many replicas:
$ kubectl get replicaset

To scalet or increase pods:
$ kubectl scale deploy/deployment deployment_name --replicas=5   [deployment name is in the deployment.yaml file]
   eg: kubectl scale deploy nginx-deployment --replicas=5
   
To scalet down the pods:
$ kubectl scale deploy nginx-deployment --replicas=1
